            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web
            pages. While HTML provides the structure of the page, CSS provides
            the the visual layout and it does that for a variety of devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup
            language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to
            maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and tailor pages to
            different environments. This is referred to as the separation of
            structure from presentation.

            Let's say we added some CSS to our document, to style it. Again, the
            HTML is as follows:
          </p>
          <p class="block lang-html">
            &lt;<span>!DOCTYPE html</span>&gt; <br />&lt;<span>html</span>&gt;
            <br />  &lt;<span>head</span>&gt; <br />    &lt;<span
              >meta charset="utf-8"</span
            >&gt; <br />    &lt;<span>title</span>&gt;My CSS
            experiment&lt;<span>/title</span>&gt; <br />    &lt;<span
              >link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"</span
            >&gt; <br />  &lt;<span>/head</span>&gt;
            <br />  &lt;<span>body</span>&gt;
            <br />    &lt;<span>h1</span>&gt;Hello
            World!&lt;/<span>h1</span>&gt; <br />    &lt;<span>p</span>&gt;This
            is my first CSS example&lt;<span>/p</span>&gt;
            <br />  &lt;<span>/body</span>&gt; <br />&lt;<span>/html</span>&gt;
          </p>
          <p>Now let's look at the corresponding CSS styling rules:</p>
          <p class="block lang-css">
            <span class="h">h1</span> { <br />  <span>color</span>: blue;
            <br />  <span>background-color</span>: yellow;
            <br />  <span>border</span>: 1px solid black; <br />} <br /><span
              class="h"
              >p</span
            >
            { <br />  <span>color</span>: red; <br />}
          </p>
          <p>
            The first rule starts with an "h1" selector, which means that it
            will apply its property values to the "&lth1>" element. It contains
            three properties and their values (each property/value pair is
            called a declaration):
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>The first one sets the text color to blue.</li>
            <li>The second sets the background color to yellow.</li>
            <li>
              The third one puts a border around the header that is 1 pixel
              wide, solid (not dotted, or dashed, etc.), and colored black.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The second rule starts with a "p" selector, which means that it will
            apply its property values to the &ltp&gt element. It contains one
            declaration, which sets the text color to red.

            When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's
            content with its style information. While the technical details of
            the process are rather complicated, here is what roughly happens:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>The browser loads the HTML file.</li>
            <li>
              It converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM
              represents the document in the computer's memory.
            </li>
            <li>
              The browser then fetches most of the resources that are linked to
              by the HTML document, such as embedded images and videos and of
              course the CSS file.
            </li>
            <li>
              The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts the different rules
              by their selector types into different "buckets", e.g. element,
              class, ID, and so on. Based on the selectors it finds, it works
              out which rules should be applied to which nodes in the DOM, and
              attaches style to them as required.
            </li>
            <li>
              The render tree is laid out in the structure it should appear in
              after the rules have been applied to it.
            </li>
            <li>
              The visual display of the page is shown on the screen (this stage
              is called painting).
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Here is a diagramm from mozilla.org that visualizes this process:

          <p>
            DOM has a tree-like structure. Each element, attribute, and piece of
            text in the markup language becomes a DOM node in the tree
            structure. The nodes are defined by their relationship to other DOM
            nodes. Some elements are parents of child nodes, and child nodes
            have siblings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding the DOM helps you design, debug and maintain your CSS
            because the DOM is where your CSS and the document's content meet
            up. When you start working with browser DevTools you will be
            navigating the DOM as you select items in order to see which rules
            apply.

        <header class="main-header">3 ways of applying CSS</header>
        <article>
          <p>There are 3 basic ways to apply CSS to yout HTML document.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Inline</b></li>
            <p>
              Inline styles are plonked straight into the HTML tags using the
              style attribute. They look like this:
            </p>
            <code> &ltp&gt style="color: red">your text&lt/p&gt </code>
            <p>
              This will make that specific paragraph red. But, if you remember,
              the best-practice approach is that the HTML should be a
              stand-alone, presentation free document, and so in-line styles
              should be avoided wherever possible.
            </p>
            <li><b>Internal</b></li>
            <p>
              Embedded, or internal, styles are used for the whole page. Inside
              the head element, the style tags surround all of the styles for
              the page. They look like this:
            </p>
            <code>
              &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt<br />
              &lthtml&gt<br />
              &lthead&gt<br />
              &lttitle&gtCSS Example&lt/title&gt<br />
              &ltstyle&gt<br />

              &nbsp&nbspp {<br />
              &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcolor: red;<br />
              &nbsp&nbsp}<br />

              &nbsp&nbspa {<br />
              &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcolor: blue;<br />
              &nbsp&nbsp}<br />
              &lt/style&gt<br />
              ...
            </code>
            <p>
              This will make all of the paragraphs in the page red and all of
              the links blue. Although preferable to soiling our HTML with
              inline presentation, it is similarly usually preferable to keep
              the HTML and the CSS files separate.
            </p>
            <li><b>External</b></li>
            <p>
              External styles are used for the whole, multiple-page website.
              There is a separate CSS file, and it looks like this:
              <code>
                &nbsp&nbspp {<br />
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcolor: red;<br />
                &nbsp&nbsp}<br />

                &nbsp&nbspa {<br />
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcolor: blue;<br />
                &nbsp&nbsp}<br />
              </code>
            </p>
            <p>
              If this file is saved as “style.css” in the same directory as your
              HTML page. It can be linked to in the HTML like this:
            </p>
            <code>
              &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt<br />
              &lthtml&gt<br />
              &lthead&gt<br />
              &nbsp&nbsp&lttitle&gtCSS Example&lt/title&gt<br />
              &nbsp&nbsp&ltlink rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt<br />
              ...<br />
            </code>
          </ol>
          <p>
            So if you want to create a site with the title "My first web page"
            and link the CSS file to your HTML in the same directory it would
            look like this:
          </p>
          <code>
            &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt<br />
            &lthtml&gt<br />
            &lthead&gt<br />
            &nbsp&nbsp&lttitle&gtMy first web page&lt/title&gt<br />
            &nbsp&nbsp&ltlink rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt<br />
            &lt/head&gt<br />
            ...
          </code>
        </article>
      </section>
    </main>
